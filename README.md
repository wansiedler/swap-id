# IdentitySwap: An On-Chain DeFi Identity Gateway

## Summary

IdentitySwap is an Automatic Money Market (AMM) dApp that 
demonstrates the concept of Decentralised Identity on the 
Solana SPL Token-Swap program. A user can interact with a 
liquidity pool only if they are in possession of a valid 
identity account, certified by a trusted identity validator. 

The association of an identity account with a transaction is stored on-chain.

## Submission

As a submission to the Solana Hackathon, we have added an identity layer to Solana,
in the form of "Identity Accounts".
